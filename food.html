    <p> Where ever you go for food at umaine you can always count on the grilled cheese and french fries. </p>
    <p> Dining halls consist of Wells, York, and Hilltop.  </p>
    <p> Also if you are feeling a bug to spend money you can go to the union </p>
    <p> Best place for food, hands down is York</p>
